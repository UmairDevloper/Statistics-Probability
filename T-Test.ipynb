    "The **T-Test** is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of one or two groups when the population standard deviation is **unknown** and the sample size is small (\\(n < 30\\)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Types of T-Tests:  \n",
    "1. **One-Sample T-Test** → Tests if the sample mean differs from a population mean.  \n",
    "2. **Independent Two-Sample T-Test** → Tests if two independent sample means are different.  \n",
    "3. **Paired Sample T-Test** → Tests if the means of two related groups (before/after) are different.  \n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "1. To test if the mean of a sample differs significantly from a known population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To compare the means of two independent groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To compare means of paired groups (before/after).\n",

    "## Application\n",
    "1. Medical Studies → Compare treatment vs. control group outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Education → Test whether two classes have significantly different average test scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Business → Evaluate before/after impact of a marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Manufacturing → Compare performance of two different production methods.\n"
