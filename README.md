# 📊 Statistics & Probability for Machine Learning

Welcome to this repository! 🚀  
This repo contains **well-structured notes, formulas, examples, and Python implementations** of important **Probability & Statistics concepts** that are essential for **Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  

All content is written in **Markdown + LaTeX math format**, so you can directly view formulas in **VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, or GitHub preview**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each concept is documented in its own markdown file:

- `anova_test.md` → Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)  
- `chi_square_test.md` → Chi-Square Test  
- `z_test.md` → Z-Test (One-Sample & Two-Sample)  
- `t_test.md` → T-Test  
- `outliers.md` → Identifying and Handling Outliers  
- `probability_rules.md` → Rules of Probability + Conditional Probability  
- `bayes_theorem.md` → Bayes’ Theorem

## 📘 What You’ll Learn

- **Core Probability Rules**  
  Complements, Addition & Multiplication rules, Conditional Probability, Law of Total Probability.  

- **Statistical Tests**  
  Z-test, T-test, Chi-square test, ANOVA test (with Python code).  

- **Bayes’ Theorem**  
  Prior, likelihood, posterior with real-world applications.  

- **Outliers**  
  Detection using Z-score & IQR method.  

- **Python Implementations**  
  Each topic comes with a small, executable Python snippet using libraries like `scipy.stats`, `numpy`, and `pandas`.
